# DBGChanger

This was made as office prank - If someone leaves computer unlocked...
Currently it changes windows background based on images on some folder on network.

Ideas for upgrade would be:
- when executed automaticallys install as windows task
- implement process hollowing
- you get the idea - hide it as best you can...


It should work on all versions of windows OS.
